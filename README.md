> 100% accurate. 

The idea of the project is to *never* make any assumption. It takes what the user responds, and repeat that as a 'personality result'. 

because the tests out there are mostly bullshit. Most are *for entertainment only*, but no users recognized that fact.

Just stop relying on the tests, and embrace not being grouped.
